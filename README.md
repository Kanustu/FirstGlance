# analysis_reporting
- this module was created with the intention of being used for very preliminary EDA, as in the first that would be run on a new dataset, it's a personal tool that I use to get a quick look at new data and what direction to then continue in
  
- using eda_report will return a pandas dataframe that combines a count of entries, the datatype of each column, the count of nulls within each column and descriptive statistics for each column.
  
- using initial_analysis will return a collection of visualizations using the numeric columns, including boxplots, histograms and correlation heatmaps, you can also set how many columns you want the boxplots and histograms to appear in.
